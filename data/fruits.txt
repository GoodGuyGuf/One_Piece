[{:name=>"Paramecia", :url=>"https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Paramecia", :start_i=>1, :end_i=>3, :bio=>"Paramecia is one of the three Devil Fruit types, being the most common out of them. This type of Devil Fruit allows the user to achieve one of a large variety of abilities that enable their consumers to become superhuman or perform a superhuman feat.\nIn the edited dub (and later episodes of the uncut dub) and official subtitles, this type is called Paramythia. The term Paramecia was first used when Wyper witnessed Luffy's Devil Fruit abilities.\nThe defining aspect of Paramecia fruit abilities is that they do not enable the user to transform into an animal like a Zoan, or transform into a natural element like a Logia. Thus, Paramecia encompasses a massive range of wildly variable powers. That being said, just about every Paramecia ability can be placed in three general categories: altering the user's body, altering the environment, and generating a substance. Some fruits only fall into one of these categories, while others can fall into multiple.\n"}, {:name=>"Logia", :url=>"https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Logia", :start_i=>1, :end_i=>4, :bio=>"Logia is one of the three Devil Fruit types, being the rarest out of all of them. This type of Devil Fruit allows the user to transform the composition of their body into a natural element at will, as well as create and control it.\nThe term Logia was first used when Raki heard about Enel's Devil Fruit abilities.\nA Logia Devil Fruit is characterized by giving its user the ability to create, control, and transform their body into a natural element.\nIf all three of these requirements are not met, then the Devil Fruit cannot be classified as a Logia type. Devil Fruits that allow the user to create and control poison, wax, or any other substance, but do not allow the user's body to transform into that element are classified under Paramecia. Likewise, Devil Fruits that change the user's body into a substance but don't bestow the power to create and control said substance are also classified as Paramecia. Meanwhile, abilities such as the Mochi Mochi no Mi are not classified as Logia fruits since they do not involve natural elements, but because their properties are similar to that of a Logia, they are classified as \"Special Paramecia\".\n"}, {:name=>"Zoan", :url=>"https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Zoan", :start_i=>2, :end_i=>4, :bio=>"Zoan-type Devil Fruits grant the user the ability to transform into another species. Zoan Fruits provide the user with three basic forms:\nHowever, through training, it is possible for Zoan users to unlock additional transformations; for instance, Marco could transform selective parts of his body, and Chopper could transform into at least seven different forms, even without the use of a Rumble Ball.\nA majority of the Zoan Devil Fruits come in different groups, known as \"series\", differentiated by specific species classification, known as \"models\". These groups are divided based on the different variations of animal; for example, the Jackal, Dachshund, and Wolf Fruits fall into the Inu Inu (Dog) series; while the Bison and Giraffe Fruits belong to the Ushi Ushi (Ox) series; and the Anaconda, King Cobra, and Yamata no Orochi Fruits are of the Hebi Hebi (snake) series.\n"}, {:name=>"Ancient Zoan", :url=>"https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Zoan#Ancient_Zoan", :start_i=>14, :end_i=>18, :bio=>"Ancient Zoan (「動物（ゾオン）系」古代種, Zōn-kei Kodaishu?, literally meaning \"Animal System Ancient Species\") is a sub-class of Zoan that allows the user to transform into ancient, extinct animals such as dinosaurs. Ancient Zoan Fruits are much rarer than regular Zoans.\nIt is implied that Ancient Zoans bestow greater physical strength than normal Zoans, in keeping with what has been exhibited by those wielding Ancient Zoan powers. For example, Drake in his allosaurus form easily bit into a Pacifista's harder-than-steel armor, Jack made concrete buildings collapse with a swing of his mammoth trunk, King could knock over the Queen Mama Chanter by ramming it in his pteranodon form, Page One as a spinosaurus-human hybrid was able to physically match a Raid Suit-donning Sanji in battle, and Ulti as a pachycephalosaurus-human hybrid could overpower Luffy by grabbing hold of him.\nAncient Zoans also have much greater durability compared to other Zoans. Page One, for example, could recover quickly from strong attacks by both Sanji wearing his Raid Suit and Luffy using Gear Third, with only minor damage, and Ulti was able to recover quickly from being struck by Yamato's kanabo. Queen survived a brief but intense onslaught from the immensely strong Big Mom and was back on his feet soon after.\nSix Ancient Zoan powers have been revealed so far, all of which are wielded by members of the Emperor-led Beasts Pirates.\nMarco's Devil Fruit is a Phoenix-type Mythical Zoan."}, {:name=>"Mythical Zoan", :url=>"https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Zoan#Mythical_Zoan", :start_i=>19, :end_i=>20, :bio=>"Mythical Zoan (「動物（ゾオン）系」幻獣種, Zōn-kei Genjūshu?, literally meaning \"Animal System Mythical Beast Species\") is a sub-class of Zoan that allows the user to transform into creatures that are the subject of myth and legend. The rarest sub-class of Zoan, Mythical Zoan types are noted to be even rarer than Logia types.\nIn accordance with their rarity, Mythical Zoans seem to be very powerful and are the strongest among Zoan types, especially because of their most distinguishing facet: the bestowing of special, unique abilities that are supplementary to the transformation itself; such as the phoenix Zoan's ability to generate flames that have healing properties, or the nine-tailed fox Zoan's ability to transform into someone's lookalike. There are some cases of users being able to access these mythical abilities without transforming. Furthermore, some of these powers can have more than one special ability, such as Kaido's dragon form being able to breath out fire, lightning and wind, while creating clouds as aerial footholds.\n"}, {:name=>"Artificial Zoan", :url=>"https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/SMILE", :start_i=>1, :end_i=>5, :bio=>"SMILEs are artificial Zoan Devil Fruits created with SAD.\nThey were formerly manufactured by Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown and were monopolized and consumed by the members Beasts Pirates, which created the classifications of the Gifters, the Pleasures, and the Waiters.\nSMILEs do not have individual names like the standard Devil Fruits, and are instead referred to as \"(Animal species) no SMILE\". In the English Sub, they are referred to as \"(Animal species) SMILE\".\nSMILEs resemble the artificial Devil Fruit that Vegapunk created; they are colorful fruits resembling apples that have spots of a different color all over them, and those spots have another spot inside each of them.\nThe key ingredient required to concoct the fruit is SAD, a substance that only Caesar Clown knows how to manufacture. As such, to produce such a Devil Fruit requires Caesar's cooperation. The SAD is produced by Caesar, which was then transferred to the SMILE Factory in Dressrosa and processed into SMILE.\n"}]
