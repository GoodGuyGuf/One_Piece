Devil Fruits that allow the user to create and control poison, wax, or any other substance, but do not allow the user's body to transform into that element are classified under Paramecia. Likewise, Devil Fruits that change the user's body into a substance but don't bestow the power to create and control said substance are also classified as Paramecia. However, some abilities, such as the Mochi Mochi no Mi, are not classified as Logia fruits despite meeting all three requirements.

The rarest sub-class of Zoan, Mythical Zoan types are noted to be even rarer than Logia types.\nIn accordance with their rarity, Mythical Zoans seem to be very powerful and are the strongest among Zoan types, especially because of their most distinguishing facet: the bestowing of special, unique abilities that are supplementary to the transformation itself; such as the phoenix Zoan's ability to generate flames that have healing properties, or the nine-tailed fox Zoan's ability to transform into someone's lookalike.
