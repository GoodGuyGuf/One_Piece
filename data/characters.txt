Luffy ", :url=>"/wiki/Monkey_D._Luffy", :start_i=>6, :end_i=>7, :bio=>"Similar to most of his male crewmates, Luffy has the same outfit throughout most of the series, unlike the other two, Nami and Nico Robin, who change frequently. Luffy often wears a different outfit to suit the climate of an island (like a hooded parka on Drum Island or desert robes in Alabasta) but will switch back to his trademark red vest and blue shorts after the adventures on that island are over. Despite this, he will wear his usual outfit in different colors and has been known to sport other miscellaneous items on his person from time to time like in Thriller Bark and Sabaody Archipelago. According to Eiichiro Oda in 37 Volume SBS, Luffy does not know how to dress stylishly so sometimes he is advised on how to dress by more fashionable team members, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, and Robin.\nNo matter where he is, Luffy wears his Straw Hat through absolutely everything, though at the start, the hat was prone to get knocked off his head easily, forcing Luffy to either put it aside or have someone hold onto it during fights. From the Alabasta Arc onward, he has gotten a string strap for it, which was sewn on by Nami, allowing the hat to hang from his neck during fights.\n"}, {:name=>"Roronoa Zoro ", :url=>"/wiki/Roronoa_Zoro", :start_i=>5, :end_i=>6, :bio=>"He currently has a bounty of 320,000,000.\nZoro is a muscular man of average height with lightly tanned skin. He always carries his three swords along with him, bundled up with a green haramaki over his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them with his left hand. Of the three swords he has on his person, he has always been seen carrying the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords have varied over time due to them being destroyed and subsequently replaced with progressively better ones. Although his right hand is usually seen resting over them, he can also use this hand to pull his swords out before sitting down. He has three identical gold earrings on his left earlobe. Zoro normally keeps a black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it around his head when he is fighting seriously against an opponent.\n"}, {:name=>"Nami ", :url=>"/wiki/Nami", :start_i=>4, :end_i=>5, :bio=>"She currently has a bounty of 66,000,000.\nNami is a slim young woman of average height with orange hair and brown eyes. Most people consider her to be very attractive or even beautiful. She has a black tattoo (blue in the anime) on her left shoulder, which represents mikan, and pinwheels (a homage to Bell-mère, Nojiko, and Genzo, respectively), where she used to have a tattoo for being a member of Arlong's crew.\n"}, {:name=>"Usopp ", :url=>"/wiki/Usopp", :start_i=>7, :end_i=>8, :bio=>"During the Drum Island Arc, he wore a brown jumper with white fur collar and cuffs, faded yellow gloves and grey pants with a black \"c\" pattern.\nDuring the walk through the desert in the Alabasta Arc, he wore a brown keffiyeh under his goggles and a dull green and black striped desert cloak.\n"}, {:name=>"Sanji ", :url=>"/wiki/Sanji", :start_i=>5, :end_i=>8, :bio=>"He currently has a bounty of 330,000,000, the third-highest in the crew after Luffy and Jinbe. Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke, the World Government labels it as part of his name on his wanted poster.\nSanji is a slim, yet muscular, long-legged man with blond hair which he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this was the left side. After the two year timeskip, he switched his hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It also appears that Sanji's hair is less straight and scruffier after the timeskip.\nAmong Sanji's physical traits are his distinctive eyebrows. Both form a spiral but at different ends. His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end, while his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. However, his eyebrows curled in the opposite direction from his siblings, which curls in a counterclockwise direction (i.e to left side). Sanji's eyebrows curled in a clockwise direction (i.e to right side).\nWhile Sanji's eyes usually seem black, he was depicted with grey-blue eyes in the anime at the beginning of Thriller Bark Arc. This is shown again during the Punk Hazard Arc, when Trafalgar Law switched Sanji into Nami's body, and her usual brown eyes became grey-blue in color.\n"}, {:name=>"Tony Tony Chopper ", :url=>"/wiki/Tony_Tony_Chopper", :start_i=>5, :end_i=>6, :bio=>"Most of the time, Chopper is a toddler-sized human/reindeer hybrid, but his Devil Fruit abilities allow him to change his appearance depending on the situation. Chopper's left antler is braced at the base by a metal plate because it was reattached after being broken during his search for the Amiudake when he was younger (where he thought the Amiudake can cure Hiriluk's disease) and ran into the leader of his old herd, who severely injured him. He usually wears a large pale red/pink fuzzy top hat with a sideways medical cross (given to him by Hiriluk) and a maroon pair of shorts. He also sometimes wears a blue backpack that has the same sideways medical cross as his hat. He also has a remarkable blue nose. As Oda's style evolved and many readers commented on how cute Chopper was, Chopper has been given a much more \"chibi\" like appearance, meaning that when in his preferred transformation (which he calls Brain Point), he has a larger head and eyes and a less defined muzzle than earlier in the series. Many female characters, such as Nami, Robin, Makino, Porche, Shakky, and Vivi find Chopper very cute. There are even males that find Chopper cute such as Foxy and Breed.\nA running gag is that various characters in One Piece think Chopper is a tanuki (raccoon-dog, often simply translated as \"a raccoon\") while in his Brain Point or hybrid form. The word \"tonakai\", which is the Japanese word for \"reindeer\", is where the \"Tony\" in Chopper's name is derived from. His Heavy Point or human form is likewise mistaken for a gorilla (or an abominable snowman on his home island).\n"}, {:name=>"Nico Robin ", :url=>"/wiki/Nico_Robin", :start_i=>8, :end_i=>9, :bio=>"In the Alabasta Arc, she wore a revealing cowgirl outfit consisting of a purple cleavage-exposing corset and matching miniskirt, both with white ornaments hanging from them, and a white fur-lined coat paired with a white cowboy hat and white high-heeled boots. At the end of the arc when she started traveling with the Straw Hats, she wore a more modest buttoned up long-sleeved lavender shirt, and purple pants and matching boots.\nIn the Skypiea Arc, along with Nami, Robin changed her outfit into something more appropriate for Angel Beach, switching into a yellow sleeveless shirt and purple pants reaching to her calves (which would not get wet as she walked on the beach), with a simple belt around her waist. She sported her white ornament on her left arm, and not needing footwear on the beach, ventured over to the shore barefoot. She put on purple high-heeled Mary Janes when she required shoes for travelling around the rest of Skypiea, and once the crew began exploring the ruins of Upper Yard, she donned her trademark white cowboy hat, which she still wore for the time being.\n"}, {:name=>"Franky ", :url=>"/wiki/Franky", :start_i=>5, :end_i=>6, :bio=>"He currently has a bounty of 94,000,000.\nAs a direct result of the modifications that he conducted upon himself as well as the years spent as a ship dismantler, bounty hunter, and street thug in Water 7, Franky is a powerfully built man with a height of at least seven feet, making him the third-tallest member of the Straw Hat crew, after Jinbe and Brook. His forearms are relatively enormous while his biceps are comparably small. His chest is well-toned with large abs and pectoral muscles. He has brightly-colored blue hair and blue star tattoos on his forearms. Franky's eyebrows are rather long and stern, and he has three prominent lower Matsuge on each eye. His chin is very angular and tapers off in three pointed clefts. Franky has an equally angular prosthetic nose made of iron with several rivets and jagged edges, the only replacement part of his exterior body that is not covered in artificial skin. \n"}, {:name=>"Brook ", :url=>"/wiki/Brook", :start_i=>5, :end_i=>7, :bio=>"Before his death, Brook was a tall, tan, skinny man who had a rather distinctive face. He had a slight goatee on his chin and some side burns. He typically wore shades never revealing his eyes. On his forehead was a scar that slightly resembles a diagonal omega sign (Ω). This scar was retained in his skeletal state as a distinctive crack across his skull. Brook's facial appearance, accompanied with his style of clothing, resembles a type of appearance and style that is commonly associated with various music artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Jimi Hendrix, Slash, and other musical celebrities with similar features.\nBrook is an extremely tall skeleton dressed in formal attire complete with top hat and cane. Standing at 266 cm (8'8½\") in height, he is the second tallest member of the Straw Hat crew, having been edged out by Jinbe. Despite having no skin, he still has an afro which he says is because his hair has very strong roots. Brook's style was that of a gentleman consisting of a coat, top hat, trousers and afro, which were black, while the inner linings of his coat were yellow-orange. The cravat that was tied in between his coat and around his neck was blue. The outer covering of Brook's cane sword which he carries was purple. Also, due to his many years of seclusion his clothes were somewhat tattered.\nHe has now changed to more colorful and high-end clothes, as though to represent a rock star. He has heart-shaped sunglasses, a yellow feather boa, a new top hat with a giant crown on the brim and orange red trousers with a floral design. Despite being a skeleton, he grew to 277 cm (9'1\").\n"}, {:name=>"Jinbe", :url=>"/wiki/Jinbe", :start_i=>2, :end_i=>4, :bio=>"Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men.\nHe was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Battle of Marineford.\nPrior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc. After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.\n"}]
