## Usage
The CLI includes the anime's characters, devil fruits information, haki description, episode count and where to watch the show!

## Development
This CLI was finished in December 2019.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Spec tests are ***only*** functional when ran individually. Running all spec tests at once will fail most, if not *all* tests. This has to do with the `scraper_spec.rb/menu_spec.rb` files. When all specs are run, `SocketErrors` appears on all failed tests:

```ruby
  SocketError:
    Failed to open TCP connection to onepiece.fandom.comhttps:443 (getaddrinfo: nodename nor servname provided, or not known)
```

The only way that `scraper_spec.rb` could function normally was with a `before(:all)` block:

```ruby
  before(:context) do
    SCRAPER = Scraper.new
  end
```

`let` & `subject` would not work for this spec. Instantiating and testing a new Scraper instance takes a long time & will not return correct values.
